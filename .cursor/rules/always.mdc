# AbstractLLM

The goal of the python project is to abstract various LLM providers and focusing primarily on Anthropic, OpenAI and Ollama. The project is similar to LiteLLM (discovered later) but focus more on open source models.

It should enable at minimum:
- text-generation
- multiple files attachment (for additional context, analysis, actions)
- tool calls with various providers
- image (for additional context, analysis, actions)

Whenever implementing a solution or fixing a bug: always check your LLM-training data for best practices and/or possibly better libraries and design patterns. Inform the user.

AbstractLLM is a new package library and it is in DEVELOPMENT phase, which means:
- write simple elegant code, do not care about backward compatibility
- if changing a strategy, do not write adapters, directly bind the working classes/methods to the new classes/methods
- this is a MVP : do NOT overengineer


**CRITICAL** : NEVER REQUEST MORE THAN 20 TOOL CALLS TO YOUR AGENT, IT MIGHT SUFFER MEMORY LOSS. INSTEAD, REPORT BACK WHEN REACHING THAT LIMIT WITH WHAT WAS DONE AND WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE
