I see several documentation files in the docs/ directory. I'll start by thoroughly examining the first 5 core documentation files one by one, beginning with data_flow.md which I've already partially seen.

Let me first read data_flow.md in its entirety:

Read file: docs/data_flow.md
Now, let's examine the architecture.md file:

Read file: docs/architecture.md
Let's continue with implementation.md:

Read file: docs/implementation.md
Let's read the logging.md file next:

Read file: docs/logging.md
Now, let's read the capabilities.md file:

Read file: docs/capabilities.md
Let me now read the first 5 documents I've examined to provide my initial analysis.

Based on the first five documentation files I've reviewed so far:

1. **data_flow.md** - This is an extremely detailed and comprehensive document at 830 lines that provides a technical analysis of the data flows and call stacks within AbstractLLM. It includes numerous mermaid diagrams that help visualize the flow of requests, configuration handling, image processing, model loading and caching, async implementations, and error handling. The document is primarily focused on the internal architecture and would be valuable for developers extending or modifying the library.

2. **architecture.md** - This document provides a high-level overview of AbstractLLM's architecture, highlighting its modular, provider-based design. It includes mermaid diagrams for components like the provider system, configuration management, media factory, and token counter. It also covers data flow, provider implementations, and extension points.

3. **implementation.md** - This is a practical guide for implementing custom providers in AbstractLLM. It provides example code for implementing the base provider class, configuration management, media handling, error handling, streaming, and vision support.

4. **logging.md** - This document details AbstractLLM's logging system, covering configuration options, log output destinations, logging formats, security considerations, and best practices for using logging in different environments (development, production, hybrid).

5. **capabilities.md** - This outlines the capabilities inspection system in AbstractLLM, showing a comparison of features across providers (like streaming, vision, system prompts, etc.), code examples for checking capabilities, and best practices for writing capability-aware code.

These documents generally seem well-structured and comprehensive, providing both high-level overviews and detailed implementation guidance. However, there appears to be some overlap in content, particularly with respect to architecture and data flow explanations.

Let me continue examining the remaining core documentation files to complete my understanding before providing a more detailed analysis.
