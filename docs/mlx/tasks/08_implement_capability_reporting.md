# Task 8: Implement Capability Reporting (COMPLETED)

## Description
Implement the capability reporting system for the MLX provider to properly advertise what features are supported.

## Requirements
1. Implement the `get_capabilities()` method required by AbstractLLMInterface ✅
2. Report accurate information about streaming, max tokens, system prompts, etc. ✅
3. Report vision capabilities based on the loaded model ✅
4. Update the capability reporting system when model changes ✅

## Implementation Details

The capability reporting system has been implemented with the following components:

```python
def get_capabilities(self) -> Dict[Union[str, ModelCapability], Any]:
    """Return capabilities of this LLM provider."""
    capabilities = {
        ModelCapability.STREAMING: True,
        ModelCapability.MAX_TOKENS: self.config_manager.get_param(ModelParameter.MAX_TOKENS, 4096),
        ModelCapability.SYSTEM_PROMPT: True,
        ModelCapability.ASYNC: True,
        ModelCapability.FUNCTION_CALLING: False,
        ModelCapability.TOOL_USE: False,
        ModelCapability.VISION: self._is_vision_capable(),
    }
    
    return capabilities

def _is_vision_capable(self) -> bool:
    """Check if the current model supports vision capabilities."""
    return self._is_vision_model
```

Additionally, a robust vision capability detection system was implemented:

```python
def _check_vision_capability(self, model_name: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a model has vision capabilities based on its name.
    
    Args:
        model_name: The name of the model to check
        
    Returns:
        True if the model likely supports vision, False otherwise
    """
    # List of keywords that indicate vision capabilities
    vision_keywords = ["llava", "clip", "vision", "blip", "image", "vit", "visual", "multimodal"]
    
    # Check if any vision keyword is in the model name (case insensitive)
    model_name_lower = model_name.lower()
    for keyword in vision_keywords:
        if keyword in model_name_lower:
            logger.debug(f"Vision capability detected for model {model_name} (matched '{keyword}')")
            return True
            
    return False
```

The model loading process was enhanced to ensure the vision capability flag is properly updated whenever a model is loaded, including when loading from the in-memory cache.

## Testing
Tests have been added to verify:
1. Basic capability reporting for standard models
2. Vision capability detection for models with vision-related keywords
3. Proper reporting of all supported capabilities
