## Review of alma-minimal.py for Image Description

The current alma-minimal.py script doesn't support image description yet. It's currently set up only for file reading with a single tool (`read_file`).

### How to Add Image Description Support

1. **Add a New Tool**: You need to add an image description tool:

```python
def describe_image(image_path: str) -> str:
    """Load an image and prepare it for model description."""
    try:
        from PIL import Image
        img = Image.open(image_path)
        return "<image loaded successfully>"  # This is just a placeholder
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error loading image: {str(e)}"
```

2. **Update the Tools List**:
```python
session = Session(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant that can read files and describe images when needed.",
    provider=provider,
    tools=[read_file, describe_image]
)
```

3. **Modify the Provider Creation** to ensure a vision-capable model:
```python
if "mlx" in providers_list:
    providers_to_try.append(("mlx", {
        ModelParameter.MODEL: "mlx-community/paligemma-3b-mix-448-8bit"  # Vision-capable model
    }))
```

## Quick Guide for Image Description

1. Add these modifications to alma-minimal.py
2. Run the script
3. Ask something like: "Describe the image in test_images/sample.jpg"
4. The model will process the image and provide a description

## MediaFactory Usage

No, the current MLXProvider implementation doesn't use AbstractLLM's MediaFactory for handling images. Instead, it:

1. Directly processes different image input types in `_process_image`
2. Handles file paths, PIL Image objects, and NumPy arrays
3. Performs in-memory resizing based on model requirements

**Recommendation**: Integrating MediaFactory would be beneficial to handle:
- URLs (remote images)
- Base64-encoded images
- Different file formats consistently
- Automatic caching

To integrate MediaFactory, you'd update the image processing to use:
```python
from abstractllm.media.factory import MediaFactory

# Then in _process_image:
media_factory = MediaFactory()
img = media_factory.load_image(image_input)
```

This would provide a more consistent interface for handling all types of media inputs including remote URLs and binary data.
